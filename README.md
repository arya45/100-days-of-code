# 100DaysOfCode progress log

### Day 11: September 19, 2016 | Back to basics

* Forked this log from [Kallaway/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).
* Learned about Markdown :)
* Decided to read through CodeSchool's Beginner's Guide to Web Development, because I am sure there is still lots that I don't know. I actually changed my editor from Notepad++ to Visual Studio Code after reading one chapter. New toy!
