# 100DaysOfCode progress log

### Day 11: September 19, 2016 | Back to basics

* Cloned this log from [Kallaway/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).
* Learned about Markdown :)
* Decided to read through CodeSchool's Beginner's Guide to Web Development, because I am sure there is still lots that I don't know. I actually changed my editor from Notepad++ to Visual Studio Code after reading one chapter. New toy!

### Day 12: September 20, 2016 | Back to basics 2

* Continued to read through CodeSchool's Beginner's Guide to Web Development: the part about Open Source is really interesting and demystifies the process of open source contribution. That's something I look forward to do, especially when I have more back-end knowledge.
* One question, the eternal one: what back-end language should I learn? What should I learn know? I started learning Python, I also remember enjoying learning Java at uni, as well as notions of PHP. I am going to stick with Python, but I also want to look into Node.js.
