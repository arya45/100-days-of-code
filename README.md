### Day 34: February 21, 2017 | About ditching Bootstrap........

Ok, ditching Bootstrap altogether seems daft, because it avoid me redoing a lot of CSS from scratch. So I am going to keep what I need from the Bootstrap CSS file and use my own breakpoints. It would surely be a great exercise for me to do the CSS from scratch at least once, to know that I can do it but I am trying to get my portfolio online asap so that is not the right project for it.

### Day 33: February 20, 2017 | Normalise.css and HTML5 Boilerplate

Working on my portfolio these last few days, I have realised that I end up overriding a lot of Bootstrap's defaults. That added to the fact that I want to get my website responsive based on its content (and not fixed breakpoints as defined in Boostrap), I decided to ditch Bootstrap altogether for my website. I love Bootstrap but I feel that my CSS knowledge is now enough for me to tackle responsiveness on a small scale project without using it.

I am going to keep Normalize.css (link below) and I might need a few lines of code from HTML5 Boilerplate, but the media queries will be content-based.

**Links:**

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) // Repository [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)

### Day 32: February 19, 2017 | Work on portfolio

* Read a bit about color schemes, how to choose complementary colours so I tuned dow my secondary colour a bit. It does look better, more my aesthetic.
* I still need to modify the footer a bit. I decided against creating a full about me page for the time being, so I'll write a few lines in the footer.

### Day 29: February 14, 2017 | Work on portfolio

### Day 28: February 12, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge #6 Type Ahead and #7 Array Cardio #2

* The amount of new knowledge I gathered from the Type Ahead challenge is heavy! I will have to take that ES6 course that Wes Bos offers.

### Day 27: February 10, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge #6 Type Ahead

* This was probably the hardest so far for me, lots of new things in vanilla JS: manipulating the DOM, RegExp constructor, fetch method. I overlooked the opportunity to use map() before Wes reminded me in hi video. I guess it'll take time before this becomes an obvious move when iterating over arrays.
* Also took the opportunity to refresh my memory on regular expressions

### Day 26: February 9, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge #5 Flex Panels and #6 Type Ahead

* Finished flex panels challenges, I can feel that I getting more and more comfortable with Vanilla JavaScript
* Started Type Ahead challenge: learned about the fetch method for AJAX, will continue tomorrow

### Day 25: February 5, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge #5 Flex Panels

* Good occasion to dip into Flexbox. Absolutely love it, it makes it so much faster to position items the way you want.
* Found this handy Flexbox Playground on CodePen (link below)

### Day 24: February 4, 2017 | Steps towards freelancing

* Created a profile on freelancer.com
* Add a look at the X ordpress theme, as recommended by Rob Percival (Udemy)
* Found a website that needs serious revamping and updating and that I will contact tomorrow

### Day 23: February 3, 2017 | VS Code + photo for portfolio

* Watching Wes Bos code in the #javaScript30 videos made me want to be more efficient when coding, so I had a proper look at the shorcuts in VS Code.
* Also spent... 2 hours taking self portraits for my website (the pink taxi must go away!)

**Link:** [VS Code Keyboard Shortcuts for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf)

### Day 22: February 2, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #4 Array Cardio Day 1

* Continued challenge: I finally understand how to work with reduce() better now. At least reduce will come to mind when working with arrays.
* Learned that querySelector (and querySelectorAll) can be applied to any element, not just document
* Learned how to convert a NodeList into an array `var arr = Array.from(node_list)`
* Learned about `string.prototype.includes()`, really useful

### Day 21: February 1, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #4 Array Cardio Day 1

* This was perfect because I know that I do not work the most efficiently on arrays.
* Learned about `console.table()` which is well handy
* Wes Bos uses the new ES6, I nee to get onto this! Arrow functions, const, let, template strings, etc.

### Day 20: January 30, 2017 | CSS bits and pieces

* Played a bit with the Codepen in the links below. The effects are really cool and don't require much CSS thanks to the mix-blend-mode and filter properties. Definitely something to look at in more depth when I do the #dailycssimages challenge maybe. There is so much to learn about!

* [Spotify Colorizer Effects Using CSS Blend Modes](https://codepen.io/vailjoy/pen/OWVwvO/)
* [CSS Reference](http://cssreference.io/)

### Day 19: January 29, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #3 CSS Variables

* I had already seen the video but had not played around with the code myself. It's a really cool aspect of CSS.
* Read more about event listeners `element.addEventListener("change", function)` vs event handlers (inline in HTML) `<div onchange="function">`

**Links:** 
* [For...of (and difference with for...in)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)
* [NodeList definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/NodeList)

### Day 18: January 24, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #2 JS + CSS Clock

* Finished the challenge! Again I learned quite a good deal: setInterval function, refresher on Date objects, CSS transition-timing-function and cube-bezier.
* Added a bit of code to temporarily disable (and reactivate) the transition effect when the second hand gets to 60 seconds to avoid weird jump.

### Day 17: January 23, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #2 JS + CSS Clock

* Working on JS + CSS clock; made the hour hand adjust with time. Next step will be doing the same for the other hands and make it dynamic.

### Day 16: January 20, 2017 | Tweaks to portfolio page

* Made it so that the projects open in a new tab when clicked
* Removed FCC icon from contacts
* Had a look around the internet for inspiration to improve my portfolio and make it more personnal and unique

### Day 15: January 19, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #3 CSS Variables

* CSS variables seem interesting and I had never heard of them before. This reminds me that I also want to have a look at SASS on of these days.
* I also learned about `<input type="color"` and `<input type="range"` today, so I'll probably play around with these and CSS variables a bit tomorrow

### Day 14: January 17, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #1

* Found what went wrong, it seems that the declaration needed to be done as two declarations. I still don't know why though...
* Worked with event listening; it's hard to unlearn jQuery!
* Finished the challenge

### Day 13: January 16, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #1

* Struggling with selecting by attribute... Syntax seems right but JS is not having it.
* Managed to find a workaround, with more lines of code though.
* Will try to understand what is wrong with my first idea because the code looks simpler than the workaround

### Day 12: January 14, 2017 | JavaScript30 Challenge #1

* Downloaded the files to start working on the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos
* Started challenge 1, discovered and read about data attributes and the kbd tag

### Day 11: January 13, 2017 | WordPress (Complete Web Developer Course - Udemy)

* Learning about themes, customisation, Rob's favourite paying themes

### Day 10: January 12, 2017 | WordPress (Complete Web Developer Course - Udemy)

* Started the WordPress section of the course on Udemy
* Intending to start a side hustle with my front-end development skills in 2017!

### Day 9: January 11, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer : final mods, published

* Hide error message when going from no results to some results
* Hid results list via CSS as initial value to avoid styling showing on empty li's
* Published on my website

**Links:** [Wikipedia Viewer](http://audreydogbeh.com/projects/wikipedia-viewer)

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer : styling

* Changed how error message is dealt with in HTML
* Styled results list, new page title font
* Added "Surprise me !" button linking to random article
* I am happy with the state of it ! Will publish on my website tomorrow.
* Maybe for later: add autocomplete, append li's instead of having them in the HTML form the beginning?

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer // CodeUp meetup & local FreeCodeCamp group

* Dealing with error message when no results are found.
* Some CSS mods.
* Went to CodeUp meet up to code, met FreeCodeCamp local group mentors. Got inspiration to add autocomplete to search bar from one of the mentors.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer: DOM mods via jQuery

* Continued work on getting the right info out of the API response and appending the DOM accordingly.
* Worked on HTML structure to add 10 search results.
* Added links to the wiki pages.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer: DOM mods via jQuery

* Worked on getting the right info out of the API response and appending the DOM accordingly. Still a good amout of work to do!

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer: useful call

* Finally! I found the right parameters for the API call. I'll use action=query & list=search & srsearch=*searchTopic* & srinfo=snippet. This gives me a simple list of 10 pages (by default) which contain the *searchTopic* in their title or content, with their title and a snippet of the text content. Just what I need.
* Next is building the HTML and populating the DOM with the results.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer

* Finally understood what callback functions and jsonp are. Tried to use that (adding &callback? at the end of the URL) and it solved the error I had, without getting into setting API-user-agent.
* Now need to understand what parameters I need to use in my call to the Wikipedia API, reading the documentation hasn't really helped...

**Links:** [jQuery’s JSONP Explained with Examples](https://www.sitepoint.com/jsonp-examples/)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 | Wikipedia Viewer

* Still getting my head around the Wikipedia API: I know now that I need to use the generator parameter to do my query, using the search term entered by the user as a value, to get a list of corresponding results.
* Been testing it on a simple example to return one result, but I am getting an request error due to the lack of user agent header in my call. Started researching how to do that; it seems that I need to use the full AJAX GET declaration instead of $.getJSON() to be able to add the API-user-agent parameter to the GET declaration.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017 | Reboot

* OK new year, new attempt at the challenge!
* Started Wikipedia Viewer from the Free Code Camp projects. It took me a while to get my head around the way the API works; not much coding done.
