# 100DaysOfCode progress log

### Day 11: September 19, 2016 | Back to basics

* Cloned this log from [Kallaway/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).
* Learned about Markdown :)
* Decided to read through CodeSchool's Beginner's Guide to Web Development, because I am sure there is still lots that I don't know. I actually changed my editor from Notepad++ to Visual Studio Code after reading one chapter. New toy!

### Day 12: September 20, 2016 | Back to basics 2

* Continued to read through CodeSchool's Beginner's Guide to Web Development: the part about Open Source is really interesting and demystifies the process of open source contribution. That's something I look forward to do, especially when I have more back-end knowledge.
* One question, the eternal one: what back-end language should I learn? What should I learn know? I started learning Python, I also remember enjoying learning Java at uni, as well as notions of PHP. I am going to stick with Python, but I also want to look into Node.js.

### Day 13: September 22, 2016 | Matt Corby tribute page responsiveness

* Read about responsiveness on different websites
* Worked on responsiveness for my tribute page: hide the nav bar when the screen is less than 992 px wide, modified grid breakpoints
* Still work to do: hide Youtube video on small screens, insert a breakpoint in between what Bootstrap classes as x-small and small ti shift to a full 12-column layout

### Day 14: September 24, 2016 | Matt Corby tribute page responsiveness 2

* Continued work on responsiveness for my tribute page: hide video on small screens, move title to avoid hiding Matt's face on small screens, created a smaller background image for mobile (loaded via media query)

### Day 15: September 25, 2016 | Matt Corby tribute page responsiveness 3 + Weather app

* Looked for a fix to problem of the beackground image being to zoomed in on mobile devices. Setting the html height to 100% seems to do the trick. It now works on my phone (even though the URL bar of the browser seems to be counted in the 100%...) and I got feeback that it seems fine on Windows Phone.
* Started to think about the Weather App (FreeCodeCamp challenge) and the OpenWeatherData API. This is going to be challenging but fun: first real app I am going to build!
