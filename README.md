# 100DaysOfCode progress log

### Day 1: April 1, 2017 | Portfolio update

Back from holidays and I couldn't delay this anymore. Plus the design was where I wanted it to be. It's more personal, more colorful while still being simple and light like my aesthetics. I am quite proud I pushed myslef to put it online today.
