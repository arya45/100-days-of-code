# 100DaysOfCode progress log

### Day 9: April 11, 2017 | ES6

Learning about template strings. I find them convenient to write strings taking in variables but Wes lost me with the HTML fragments and using functions. I will re-watched the videos with a less tired brain.

### Day 8: April 9, 2017 | ES6

More about arrow functions and when not to use them. I used the internet to complete the first exercise but I am glad to notice that what I was after was syntax things and not actually "how do I do that?"

### Day 7: April 8, 2017 | ES6

Learning about arrow functions, clearly a great way to make code a bit more compact!

### Day 6: April 7, 2017 | ES6

More about let, const and var and some arguments on when to use which.

### Day 5: April 6, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge 8: HTML5 canvas

Really cool, I'd be interested to see what people have made with it. And I should also dive into SVG... maybe?

### Day 4: April 4, 2017 | Started learning ES6

It had been on my list for a while, I bought Wes Bos's es6 course. I like that the videos are short and to the point.

### Day 3: April 3, 2017 | #JavaScript30 challenge 9: Dev Tools tricks

As always with Wes Bos, I learned a few cool stuff to do in the console. To be honest I should really try and understand how to use the Dev Tools for debugging, with breakpoints and all that. This is on my ever-growing list of things to learn.

### Day 2: April 2, 2017 | Minor CSS tweaks to portfolio

The text in the "About me" section was a bit small on mobile devices, so I increase the size through media queries. I should have picked that up before putting online!

### Day 1: April 1, 2017 | Portfolio update

Back from holidays and I couldn't delay this anymore. Plus the design was where I wanted it to be. It's more personal, more colorful while still being simple and light like my aesthetics. I am quite proud I pushed myslef to put it online today.
