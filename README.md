# 100DaysOfCode progress log

I am back at it! Clearly I am not done with programming. I graduated from the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity, so I am eager to practice my new found skills on personal projects, while using Git for version control. I am also considering learning about .NET for my line of work and looking into back-end web development.
Recently, I have been refreshed my skills on [Git with Udacity] (https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) and I started a data project in Jupyter Notebook, related to the crazy housing market in Copenhagen.

I am not planning on coding every day, I prefer having a relatively long block of time to do that rather than 30 minutes here and there. But the goal is to keep the momentum going and not go more than 1 week without learning/programming/thinking about a project.

### Day 1: June 27, 2021

Learned about `git fetch`, `git pull`, `git push`. Restarted my 100 days of code progress. Wrote some details about my housing market project, for planning.

### Day 2: June 29, 2021

Added my Udacity data analysis project exploring the incidence of missed medical appointments in a dataset of 110.000+ medical appointments in Brazil. The repo is called "noshow-brazil". I need to add a README in the coming days.

### Day 3: June 30, 2021

Added my Udacity data analysis project exploring a dataset of Prosper consumer loans. In that project I looked at correlations between different factors and the incidence of defaulted loans.

Commited the start of my personal project "apartment-sales", which will look into the housing market in Copenhagen.

### Day 4: July 2, 2021

Started learning about Power BI on Microsoft Learn.
